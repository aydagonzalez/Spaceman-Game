# SPACEMAN GAME
A description of your game. Background info of the game is a nice touch.

The "Spaceman" game is a word-guessing game, where the player tries to figure out a secret word within a certain number of attempts. Here's how the game works:

The game has generated a secret word for you to guess. You have a limited amunt of this guesses, in this particular game you will have five available of guesses.

The player begins by making a guess by click the letter on the keyboard.
Correctly guessed letters will be revealed in their correct positions in the secret word, while incorrect guesses are marked as incorrect and the buttons on the keyboard are disabled.
If the player correctly guesses all the letters in the secret word within the limited number of attempts, they win. Otherwise, they lose and they get to play again.

The player can try various strategies to deduce the secret word, such as identifying patterns, or making educated guesses based on the context of the game (hint: the context of the game is thing in space!).
